Coming to the results of our prototype, 



Model metrics 
we used the following models to make predictions, which are displayed on our dashboard.

Our primary reason for choosing the XGBoost is for model performance, the same model when created using linear regression model on big query gave an accuracy of 50% accuracy.
Additionally XGBoost is significantly faster.

One of the models created is a logistic regression model to predict the most prominent payment method being used. the results were quite surprising. We will show the results in the upcoming slides.

Dashboard 

Our final product, a real time dashboard created on tableau visualizing the most noteworthy locations in New York for picking up passengers.
The dashboard is updated on a 7 min window. we take into account all weather conditions and have produced the following results.

As you can see cash payments are preferred over card and its by a significant margin.

Conclusion

In conclusion we have a highly scalable real time dashboard which gives taxi companies and drivers alike a significant edge over the competition. While we made sure to cover all basis there is scope for improvement.

1. We need to make consideration to consume less quota on big query as the overhead is pretty high when querying data over 200 GB.

2. performance can improved by segmenting the model (different models)to take into account for temporal changes.
