Gojek was able to use Dataflow to build a streaming event data pipeline.

This let driver locations ping Pub/Sub every 30 seconds, and Dataflow would process the data.

The pipeline would aggregate the supply pings from the drivers against the booking requests.

This would connect to Gojekâ€™s notification system to alert drivers where they should go.

This process required a system that was able to scale up to handle times of high throughput and then back down again.

Dataflow was able to automatically manage the number of workers processing the pipeline to meet demand.

The Gojek team was also able to visualize and identify supply and demand issues.
