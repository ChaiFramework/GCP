GCP Deliverables: 

Connect Pub/Sub to NYC GitHub repo to emulate streaming of the NYC Taxi and Limousine data. 

Setup Apache Beam to be used as model to create a data processing pipeline 

Use Dataflow as an execute engine to implement the data pipeline 

Feed outputs from Dataflow to BigQuery (data warehouse) to execute queries to generate insights from the data.

What do we want to display?

Which areas have high demand for taxiâ€™s wrt to the weather at different times 

How the payment type varies with time?
